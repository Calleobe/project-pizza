# Project Pizza - Week 1 Assignment

Week 1 assignment is to make a small webpage in javascript where you can order food.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
I used conditional statements, prompts and alerts which was described in the project brief. I do have experience in other programming languages so it wasnÂ´t so hard. I did learned to use "===" instead of "==" which im used to.
